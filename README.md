# Introduction

This repository will contain mostly mathematical algorithms implemented in Go as well as some exercises and problems solved in [projecteuler](https://projecteuler.net) or any other source of learning. 

The main goal is for me to understand the underlying concepts and to keep track of my progress learning Go as well.
